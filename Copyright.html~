<h1>Suggested Changes to the Copyright Transfer Practice<br>
</h1>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Please
click </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="#dev">here</a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> for the recent developments (September
2007 - February 2008) and <a href="#Conclusions">here</a> for
conclusions. -OP</span><br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>I want to present gere some of my thoughts and ideas on the current
relations between
mathematicians and journal publishers.<br>
</p>
<p>In this context, the main role of publishing companies is to
disseminate
mathematical knowledge. It is reasonable that they charge for their
services, or even make considerable profits, provided this does not
impair
the quality of their service.
</p>
<p>However, we see some quite alarming trends in recent years. It seems
that
the high prices on many paper journals (which often exceed by far any
reasonable estimates of the publication costs) force academic
institutions to
opt for a temporary access to the online versions. For example, even
Carnegie Mellon University, one of the most prestigious technical
universities in the USA, stopped (in 2004) the paper subscription to <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Discrete Applied Mathematics</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Discrete Mathematics</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Journal of Combinatorial Theory </span>(both
Series A and B), and many
other journals.&nbsp; Thus the access to these issues for the future
CMU researchers will completely depend on the publishers' providing the
on-line service at an acceptable price.<br>
</p>
<p>At the same time, a typical copyright transfer form that the
publishers currently require the
authors to sign gives the publishers a practically unrestricted control
over the contribution. (For example, do mathematicians have any, even
slightest, control over the journal prices now?) Essentially, the only
legally allowed ways for
disseminating the article without the publisher's permission are
limited
to the authors' personal web-pages and sharing (p)reprints with
colleagues. This relies on the authors' willingness and possibility to
do
so; thus in no way it can serve as the primary source of scientific
reference. (Especially that many publishers explicitly forbid putting
the final version on web.) <br>
</p>
<p>There are could be many reasons why an article cannot be obtained
from the author: <br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>the author is dead either physically or in the meaning used by
Erd&ouml;s (that is, not doing research anymore);<br>
  </li>
  <li>the author is not so impeccably organized as to have copies of
all papers readily available; <br>
  </li>
  <li>the author&nbsp; is too busy to put preprints on-line or post
copies on request. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
Actually, there is a good excuse/reason for the last type of behavior:
mathematician's direct duty is to prove beautiful theorems and write
them up while the mundane task of copying/posting/cataloging is just a
waste of time which could be spent more productively otherwise.
<p>Hence, in 10-20 years private publishers will hold exclusive
rights to a large share of the mathematical research published today.
So,
if huge prices will happen to generate more revenue (even if fewer
copies
are sold), it is very likely that the publishers will take the
advantage of it. (This seems to happen already.) It is obvious who will
suffer most in this scenario.<br>
</p>
<p>In my opinion, a possible solution to this problem is to change the
terms
and conditions of the agreement between the authors and&nbsp; the
publishers. In a nutshell, I suggest to use the essentially the same
copyright form,
except for the following clause (which is also included into the text
of the article):</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">"After
[DATE]&nbsp; this article can be freely copied in any quantities, on
any media, and by any parties, also for the purposes of selling. The
content of the article, including this notice, must be passed unaltered
at all times."</span><br>
</p>
<p>This means that for a certain period of time (say, 10 years after
the publication date) the
Publisher holds the rights comparable with the current practice. This
is a
sufficiently long period to make institutions buy either the paper
version
or the electronic access. At the end of this period, the published
article
can be freely duplicated, on any media, in any quantities, by anybody,
provided its content is not altered in any way. Similarly to the GNU
General Public License, it is reasonable to allow anybody to
resell the article after the expiration date. The
clause stipulating this and stating the expiration date is to be
included also
into the content of the article and, therefore, must be always passed
unaltered.
</p>
<p>The advantages of this proposal are that publishers can still make
profits
(and thus will be interested in maintaining their services) while
mathematicians, especially those from poorer institutions, will clearly
benefit. The examples of some successful journals, such that Annals of
Mathematics or Electronic Journal of Combinatorics, show that it is
possible to combine a high scientific level even with the immediate
free
full-text access. Also, the articles bearing such a clause are clearly
identifiable.<br>
</p>
<p>Suppose (as a wishful dreaming) that all major publishers announced
that all pre-2000 articles can be copied without any restriction. It is
likely that almost all important articles (e.g. the original
Szemer&eacute;di's regularity lemma) would become available for free
somewhere in the cyberspace fairly soon. This is so because the
existence of just one person who scans the article into a pdf-file and
puts the article's authors and title inside the link (so that google
can index it) would be enough here. A few enthusiasts should suffice
for starting a repository of published articles with expired copyright.
Probably, there would be enough volunteers to develop a free database,
not inferior to any of those currently offered by publishers. The
examples of e.g. Linux or the current refereeing process, both based on
people's willingness to contribute their effort and time to a good
cause, make me believe so. <br>
</p>
<p>Of course, there are drawbacks too. One of them is that, even if a
precedent is set, it is not clear if the other journals will endeavor
to
follow it. Also, the transition to new terms may disrupt some
established
routines. But, in my opinion, the mathematical community would overall
benefit from publishing contributions under new terms.<br>
</p>
<p>Obviously, we cannot expect private publishers to embrace this
initiative,
since it will eventually cut down their income. The most effective way
would be for a large group of mathematicians (e.g. AMS, ICM, etc) to
organize a referendum on these issues and, if the outcome is strongly
in the favor of changing the current system, to publicize widely the
results. (So that academic publishers would have to address this issue
somehow or risk losing their reputation of being supporters of
science.) Unfortunately, this does not look very likely to happen in
near
future. <br>
</p>
<p>My next step would probably be to ask the publishers to publish my
accepted papers under the proposed new terms. This
approach is extremely unlikely to succeed, but my modest aim at this
stage is to draw the attention of other mathematicians to this problem
(and to a possible solution). I'll try to record here any failures or
successes in this direction at this webpage. <br>
</p>
<p>I won't be collecting any signatures or maintaining a discussion
group, but I'll be very glad to hear any suggestions or comments on the
topic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.<br>
</p>

<h2><a name="dev"></a>New Developments<br>
</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">September 2007:</span><br>
</p>
<p>Recently, I learned of an earlier <a
 href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200403/commentary.pdf">article</a> by
John Ewing in the Notices of AMS who made similar suggestions (but much
better argumented and designed than mine). As of now, his ideas are
implemented by the American Mathematical Society. Namely, the authors
of journal articles have the option to dedicate their article to public
domain 28 years after publication: if they opt for this, then the
corresponding statement appears on the title page of the published
article. So far this scheme seems to work and not to cause any legal
problems for the publisher or the authors.<br>
</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought this to be a good time to raise the issue again
with the Elsevier (see <a href="#again">here</a>) and to see if
Springer, another major publisher, would be willing to implement these
changes (see <a href="#springer">here</a>).<br>
</p>
<p>Also, the <a href="http://ajc.math.auckland.ac.nz/">Australasian
Journal of Combinatorics</a> seems to give a free on-line access to
papers that are 4 or more years old. Very nice of them! <br>
</p>
<p><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">October 2007:</span><br>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the experiment with the Springer was unsuccessful: I
was faced with the alternatives: either to sign the stardard copyright
transfer form or never ever publish with <span
 style="font-style: italic;">"Graphs &amp; Combinatorics"</span>. (So
my decision was obvious.) It is unfotunate and rather surprising, since
I have always regarded the Springer as the friendliest one among the
major scientific publishers (because, for example, they have the cost
of many textbooks and monographs relatively low when compared with some
competitors). Yet,&nbsp; their reaction to my request was the most
negative so far. Although it formally came from the editors of the
journal, one can notice by looking at the correspondence that Mrs van
Straalen, Head of Rights, Rights and Permissions Department of Springer
chose not to reply to my emails or to voice any opinion on the matter
at all, thus implicitly endorsing the decision of the editor of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">"Graphs &amp; Combinatorics"</span>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">February 2008:</span><br>
</p>
<p>As it turned out, my papers with <span style="font-style: italic;">"Graphs
&amp; Combinatorics"</span> did come out with the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">"Reverts to public domain 28 years from
publication"</span> statement on the title page :-) I do not know
whether this was an overlook or intentional, but this happened.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>Also, I discovered that NIH (the National Institute of Health)
will require from April 2008 that the scientists supported by its grant
are required to
provide a preprint of any article published to be included in a
free-access server (<a
 href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/advocacy/nih/index.html">read more</a>).<br>
</p>
<p>I was involved with a similar correspondence with Wiley (in
January 2005) about our paper <span style="font-style: italic;">"How
Complex are Random Graphs in First Order Logic?"</span>, where we tried
to do what <a
 href="http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/diestel/copyright.html">Reinhard
Diestel suggests</a>.
The publisher (Wiley) outright refused to published our paper unless we
sign
the unaltered copyright form, so we, the authors, had to agree.
(Unfortunately, I have not made any copies of emails from that
discussion.)<br>
</p>
<p>No answer from the Elsevier...<br>
</p>
I do not think there is much I want to add here, so perhaps, I'll round
everything up with some conclusions.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2><a name="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions<br>
</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The current copyright transfer system does not work well.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Most of the major journal publishers (Elsevier, Springer, Wiley)
are very reluctant to change their copyright policies.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Also, not all scientists agree with the arguments put forward
here.<br>
  </li>
  <li>There are viable solutions to this problem, the best one probably
being John Ewing's&nbsp;<a
 href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200403/commentary.pdf">suggestion</a>.
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>There are some big organizations that are in favor of free
availability of scientific publications (AMS, NIH, SPARC).</li>
</ol>
So, what should be done? Personally, I'll probably keep asking to
include the clause <span style="font-style: italic;">"Reverts to
public domain 28 years from publication"</span> in the accepted
articles but, if this request is declined, I would agree to the
publisher's terms. Things can change and one never knows.<br>

<h2>Correspondence with the Elsevier<br>
</h2>
In September 2005, I made a request to the Elsevier to publish my paper
"Exact Computation of the Hypergraph Turan Function for
Expanded Complete 2-Graphs" (accepted by the Journal of Comb Theory
(B))
at the terms specified above.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the publication of my paper was suspended for an
indefinite time. I thought this would be a good opportunity to provide
here the opinion of a major publisher on the raised matter. An outline
of the communication is given below.<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">Dear Dr Boer,</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Thank you for your letter. I
agree that the Elsevier is very generous in</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">allowing the authors to put the
final published versions on their</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">homepages. However, as the
author, I wish to ensure that my contribution</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">is freely available to the future
mathematical community, even after I</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">cease to maintain my homepage.</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">I believe that the proposed extra
clause would not require any changes in</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">the current publishing routines.
The Elsevier would be able to distribute</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">the contribution as usual as well
as to have the full freedom in the</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">pricing policies. The extra
clause, after it takes effect in 2016, does</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">not restrict any of these in any
way. (Although the number of downloads</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">from the Publisher's website
might drop down after 2016.) The only</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">limitation is that, after 2016,
the Elsevier would not be able to initiate</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">any lawsuit against third parties
for copying the distribution.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">If you would be willing to
provide the reasons as to why the proposed</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">addition is unacceptable, this
would be very helpful. (I admit that it is</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">quite possible that I have
overlooked some important point.)</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">

 style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">I understand your viewpoint very
clearly. However, I am afraid that we have</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">a company-wide copyright policy
which applies to all articles which appear</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">in Elsevier journals. It is
therefore not possible to change this policy for</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">a single article as you suggest.
Furthermore, this would create a precedent</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">that could have implications for
other articles in the future and this is</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">not supported by my company.</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">I sincerely hope that you
understand this and are still willing to publish</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">your article with us. In any case
there is nothing that I can do for you in</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">this respect. If this is a reason
for you to withdraw your article for</span><br

From: Oleg Pikhurko<br>
<br>
Dear Editors,<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the Publisher and me could not agree on the terms of the<br>
publication of my paper YJCTB 2354. My reasons for asking for an<br>
alteration to the standard copyright transfer form are stated here:<br>
<br>
http://www.math.cmu.edu/~pikhurko/Copyright.html<br>
<br>
I do not wish to withdraw the article nor resubmit it to another
journal.<br>
I would rather regard it as accepted by JCTB, with publication suspended<br>
for an indefinite period. I intend to put it on arxiv.org and will be
very<br>
happy to publish it in JCTB later if the Publisher agrees to the
suggested<br>
changes and you still believe that the contribution is of interest to
the<br>
JCTB readership.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to inform you about this development and ask you to spend
as<br>
little time as possible (or none at all) on this matter. In my opinion,<br>
JCTB is a very good journal and you do an excellent job as editors. So I<br>
would really hate it if you wasted your time on this incident.
Especially,<br>
that it is not clear if the proposed copyright alteration could work in<br>
practice and would be supported by other mathematicians. I feel strongly<br>
about this case, that's why I do not mind investing my time and efforts<br>
into it. But I do not wish to force anybody into any discussions and<br>
arguments, without their willing so.<br>
<br>
At this stage, my objective is to make other mathematicians and the<br>
publishers aware of this issue and a possible solution. There isn't much<br>
use in making the point more than once, so I expect to submit more
papers<br>
to JCTB and publish them on the standard copyright terms.<br>
<br>
I thank you for your excellent work.<br>
<br>
Yours Sincerely,<br>
Oleg Pikhurko<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">Dear Dr. Pikhurko,</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">I have discussed this matter with
the editors and they feel that this is a</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">matter between the author and the
publisher. In view of this, I have looked</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">at the options one last time but
I am sorry to inform you that our policy</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">cannot be changed. It will not be
possible to suspend the publication of</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">your article for an indefinite
time as you suggest. Currently there are two</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">options:</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">(1) We will proceed with the
publication of your article on the explicit</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">understanding that you will sign
and return an unaltered copy of the</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">standard Transfer of Copyright
form. If you do not want to sign this form</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">and your article is not
withdrawn, we will publish the article with an</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Elsevier copyright line.</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">(2) You can withdraw your article
from publication.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Please let me know at your
earliest convenience which of these two options</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">you prefer.</span><br

<span style="font-family: monospace;">Dear Dr Boer,</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">I am afraid that the option (1)
is unacceptable to me and I explictly</span><br

contribution unless all my requests, as</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">specified in my email to Dr
Rockett of September 6, 2005, are met.</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">At the same time, I would not
make any formal request to withdraw my</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">article. If you do not agree with
the phrase "publication suspended for an</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">indefinite period", this is
understandable. In this case, I would suggest</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">the formulation "not published
because of a disagreement over the</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">copyright" or a similar one.</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">

To Whom it May Concern,<br>
<br>
My article "Exact Computation of the Hypergraph Turan Function for<br>
Expanded Complete 2-Graphs" (accepted by the Journal of Combinatorial<br>
Theory B in 2005) was not published because of the disagreement over the<br>
copyright. This article has not been submitted nor published in any
other<br>
peer-review journal. Please refer to<br>
<br>
http://www.math.cmu.edu/~pikhurko/Copyright.html<br>
<br>
for details. Roughly speaking, my requirement was that, after 10 years<br>
from publication, everybody should be legally allowed to make unaltered<br>
copies of the article, on any media and in any quantities.<br>
<br>
Currently, the American Mathematical Society gives the authors of<br>
journal publications the option of reverting their articles to public<br>
domain 28 years after publication. Please see:<br>

I am willing to publish my article "Exact Computation of the Hypergraph<br>
Turan Function for Expanded Complete 2-Graphs" in Elsevier's Journal of<br>

Dear Professor Kano,<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the Publisher and I could not agree on the terms of the<br>
publication of my paper GC 2146. My reasons for asking for an alteration<br>
to the standard copyright transfer form are stated here:<br>
http://www.math.cmu.edu/~pikhurko/Copyright.html<br>
<br>
Please also see an article by John Ewing in the Notices of AMS whose<br>
suggestions are now implemented by the AMS:<br>
http://www.ams.org/notices/200403/commentary.pdf<br>
<br>
I do not intend to submit this manuscript for a publication to any other<br>
journal but rather wait until Sprinder reconsiders its copyright
policies<br>
for journals, however long it may take.<br>
<br>
I will continue to submit and publish other papers with Springer (in<br>
particular in Graphs and Combinatorics) and to sign the standard
copyright<br>
transfer form, except for the above paper. The purpose of my action is
to<br>
draw attention to this issue and, hopefully, to facilitate a better<br>
solution than the existing practice.<br>
<br>
This email is just to keep you informed of this developement. I do not
ask<br>
you to take any action or express your opinion on this matter.<br>
<br>
Let me take an opportunity and thank you once again for the great work
you<br>

As you know, copyright is very important for the publisher,<br>

his paper in some journal,<br>
he shoud send the copyrigh form of the publisher<br>
to the pubisher, otherwise, the pape is not publisehd.<br>
<br>
We of course follow the decision of the publisher.<br>
<br>
Also if you don't agree to the decision of the publisher,<br>
we dot not want to deal with your papers any more<br>
because it is just a meaningless work for us.<br>
<br>
We do not touch the problem on<br>

<br>
Dear Professor Kano,<br>
<br>
"Graphs and Combinatorics" is an excellent journal. I absolutely do not<br>
want to risk the privilege of publishing in G&amp;C.<br>
<br>
Probably, I was not very clear in my last email. So let me stress again<br>
that, independently of the outcome of the copyright issue with the
current<br>
paper, I will be signing the unaltered Publisher's copyright form for
all<br>
my other submissions accepted by G&amp;C.<br>
<br>
Also, I completely agree with you that the copyright terms are out of<br>
editor's work (and should be handled by the copyright office of the<br>
Publisher). I thought that Ms Honma belonged to that office or that she<br>
would forward my request there.<br>
<br>
Therefore, all that I kindly ask of you is to refrain from taking any<br>
actions on my manuscript GC 2146 until I get in touch with the<br>
corresponding office at Springer and some decision is reached. This
should<br>
keep the editorial office uninvolved and undistracted from their primary<br>
duties.<br>
<br>
I can only imagine how much efforts and time it takes to edit a major<br>
mathematical journal and that an unexpected hindrance in publishing
even a<br>
single article can be very discouraging for the editors. I sincerely<br>
apologize for this.<br>
<br>

The problem about the copy right is mainly<br>
between you and Springer, the publisher.<br>
However I also have a list and pay attention<br>

<br>
If you do not send us the copy right form<br>

this paper will not be published.<br>
Also we will stop the process of refereeing<br>
of the following your another paper GC2412<br>
because we don't want to do meaningless work.<br>
We could not understand why you submited your papers<br>
