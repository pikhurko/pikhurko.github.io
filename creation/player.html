I Believe in Living Life Dangerously</h1></center>

<div align=right><i>"I believe in living life dangerously"</i>
<br><i>(HRH The Prince of Wales)</i></div>

<br><i></i>&nbsp;I am a Player. I am a bold Player. I am a reckless Player.
I go straight forward. My path is a knife edge. Step aside---and you are
over. To make a step back you need to make step aside first. Anyway, I'm
not going to turn back, nor turn right, nor turn wrong. I am a Player.
I am a bold Player. I am a reckless Player. I go straight forward. The
first step on the knife edge was utter madness. Every following step would
be a madness hundred times greater. But I am a Player. I am a bold Player.
I am a reckless Player. I go straight forward.
<p>Let's venture Life. Let's take a venturesome narrow-edge tour through
Life. A real adventure. Challenge for a Player. Fortify your will. Deny
your conscience. Do not appeal to sense. Player. Go. Straight. Forward.
<p>Life... The best known thing, yet still the least explored one. A Puzzle
we solve every day, yet still an Enigma to be resolved. The Magnet of Human
Thought. For years and centuries people have been trying to understand
it. Mathematicians are searching for the Logic of Life. Yet Life itself
contradicts any Logic. Philosophers are looking for the Sense of Life.
Yet Life itself has no Sense, and in this is its Main Sense. Poets are
longing for the Beauty of Life. Yet Life itself is so brilliant, that even
its ugliness is Beautiful.
<p>Mathematicians, Philosophers, Poets... They are going in different directions,
yet each approaches the Truth. Each is right, but the Truth mocks at them:
"I am deeper." The Truth denies any Logic, it doesn't need any Sense, the
idea of Beauty cannot be applied to it.
<p>Life is composed of contradictions like a book is composed of symbols.
Wipe away the letters and make the story wither. Smooth down any sharp
bends and make Life colourless, lifeless, and dangerless!
<p>Verily, I am a Player. I am a bold Player. I am a reckless Player. I
want Life to be sharper. Keener. Brighter. I am not afraid of contradictions.
I need contradictions. I cannot get along without them. I must live dangerously.
<p>Light, become lighter... So that dark spots would darken...
<p>World, stretch out infinitely... Just to reach you limits...
<p>Determinism and free will... They cannot coexist. They cannot live separately
either. Determinism is the key to the door of Reality, but only free will
can unlock it. Without lock the key is useless, without determinism the
free will is senseless. Beggar, you, who has got nothing, lose even this
your only possession... Lose Nothing... And be you blessed then... "Blessed
are the poor... "Blessed are the sorrowful... "Blessed are the meek...
"Blessed are the merciful...
<p>Really, in this game the player with the worst cards wins. The outcome
is always predictably unpredictable: Winner loses, Loser wins... Oh Lord,
You are too merciful!.. You unjustly pour on us your immense justice...
We do deserve injustice, oh Lord...
<p>There won't be a heavenly Judge over you on the Doomsday. There won't
be any Doomsday after your Death. There won't be any Death at all... You
will be your own Judge. Your life will be your own Doomsday. Your Death
will be your new birth. The Death will open your eyes, and you will know
both good and evil. Sinners, this will be your punishment: to see your
life over and over again. You will realize the thorough Perfection of the
Soul of Man. You will realize yet the more thorough greatness of your Misery,
which managed to turn your Perfection into the Misery. Every day of your
life. Every hour. Every minute. And be so for ever and ever. Truly, they
are receiving their reward now.
<p>Holy men, this will be your reward: to see your life over and over again.
To perceive your Goodness and your Godliness. Every day of your life. Every
hour. Every minute. And be so for ever and ever. Truly, they are receiving
their reward now. Do not count somebody else's flaws, to not make your
burden harder, but do count somebody else's virtues to make their burden
lighter. Oh, pray for us, Diviners, for our burden is heavy... We are afraid
of what awaits us after our death, we are afraid of that eternity, we are
afraid of our future immortality. It frightens us. So, because we are afraid
of our immortality, we desperately trying to avoid death... You are the
closest person to yourself. But the way to yourself is always the longest
one... The whole life might not suffice. And in this longest path, the
initial and the final points coincide...
<p>You have only one life. In every life there may be only one True Love.
And True Love is always a true tragedy... Your True Lover will be the Alpha
and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last, your
relief and your pain. "But, I do not want to suffer. I do not want to grieve.
I do not want to love... Please, give me the medicine curing the Love"---"You
do not need one: your immortal True Love died with your very first thought
about the retreat ... It's been dead since long ago." "Then give me the
medicine, curing every disease." Alas! there is no such medicine. For it
is not the medicine that heals, but the hands which give you this medicine.
<p>Verily, there was such a medicine: your Lover's hands could heal everything.
Your Lover's hands could have healed everything.
<p>The Purest Joy is inevitably followed by the Purest Despair. Because
everything, compared with the moment of the Greatest Happiness, would be
the Greatest Sadness. The reverse, unluckily, is not true. Moreover, to
anybody who experienced the Greatest Despair, all ways to the Greatest
Joy are tabooed. They are only one-way roads, actually...
<p>Oh Lord, You are too cruel!.. You unjustly pour on us your immense justice...
We do deserve injustice, oh Lord...
<p>My body is tired. My heart is thirsty. My soul is wearied. Am I a reckless
Player? No... Am I a bold Player? No... Am I a Player? No... But I am on
a straight narrow knife edge. Shall I go straight forward? I am too weary...
Do I want to live dangerously? Do I want to live?.. I am making a step
aside...
