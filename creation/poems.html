<br><hr><h3><a name="1">Cambridge without proofs</a></h3>
<i>Dedicated to H.F. </i><br>
<br>I cannot tell how nice is Cambridge; 
<br>I have a heart, but not a language. 
<br>Such is my fate, my destination - 
<br>To have vocabulary of bounded variation. 
<br>
<br>Why is here the birth of every new day 
<br>When sleepy beams against the Darkness strife, 
<br>Like kissing a fairy princess in the night of May, 
<br>Like taking the first integral of your life? 
<br>
<br>Unlimited are fantasies of naughty Cam 
<br>When it displays with heavenly perfection 
<br>The shapes of meadows, clouds, men, 
<br>Oddly changed by some non-linear reflection. 
<br>
<br>Two banks: the sister and the brother, 
<br>Two loving hearts by water split, 
<br>For said the God: "Not cross each other" - 
<br>Proving the second axiom of great Euclid. 
<br>
<br>Spring Flowers, the first drops of star-dust 
<br>With perception appeal to every your sense. 
<br>They have grown from the seeds of lust 
<br>Topologically open and everywhere dense. 
<br>
<br>What use of Mathematics, tell me please 
<br>When it cannot make a single step near 
<br>To formally proving anything of these: 
<br>Theorems, too self-evident and clear. 
<br>
<br>Cambridge, 27 April 1996

<br><hr><h3><a name="2">Take my Heart Away</a></h3>
<br>Take my heart away 
<br>It brings me only pain 
<br>I hear its beating every day 
<br>Like drops of Autumn rain. 
<br>
<br>Like drops of Autumn rain 
<br>My tears, my thoughts, my eyes 
<br>My hands, my head, my brain: 
<br>Too heavy to fly in the skies. 
<br>
<br>Too heavy to fly in the skies - 
<br>My only chance to meet 
<br>The only love that never lies 
<br>The only lips like roses sweet. 
<br>
<br>The only lips like roses sweet 
<br>Await for me in distant May, 
<br>Meters, miles, inches, feet - 
<br>Take my heart away. 
<br>
<br>Cambridge, 14 April 1996

<br><hr><h3><a name="3">My Favorite Tale</a></h3>
<i>Dedicated to T.M. </i><br>
<br>I?m posessed by a wonderful fairy tale 
<br>No one ever knew; 
<br>With a real Princess, like snow pale: 
<br>The Princess was you. 
<br>
<br>Your haunting beauty was a bliss; 
<br>Fragnance of dew. 
<br>No great master could paint a piece 
<br>Deserving you. 
<br>
<br>Glamorous Palace, where the Highnesses 
<br>Grew and grew, 
<br>Was made so severely famous 
<br>Only because of you. 
<br>
<br>I was a pauper (his poor fashion!) 
<br>But happy and free: 
<br>Your love was the only possession 
<br>Belonging to me. 
<br>
<br>One night, from the palace, riches, delight 
<br>The Princess did flee. 
<br>Great sorrow in Kingdom, nobody can find 
<br>Neither you, nor me... 
<br>
<br>* * * 
<br>
<br>Legend and reality: face and veil, 
<br>Which is more true? 
<br>What favorite fairy tale 
<br>Have you? 
<br>
<br>Is there me?

<br><hr><h3><a name="4">Waiting for You...</a></h3>
<i>Dedicated to U.L. </i><br>
<br>I am waiting for You... 
<br>Day or Night, Sunlight or Dusk 
<br>Even in rain, 
<br>Waiting for my sweetheart, my joy, 
<br>And my pain. 
<br>
<br>I am waiting for You... 
<br>Like the Star is waiting the Sun 
<br>In the Sky; 
<br>To see it, to touch it, to love it 
<br>And to die. 
<br>
<br>I am waiting for You... 
<br>Never so I wanted, Riches, Might 
<br>Nor Fame. 
<br>Wherever I go, whispers me the Wind 
<br>Your Name. 
<br>
<br>I am waiting for You... 
<br>I?m bound to Time (my endless mate), 
<br>Together we go. 
<br>Tell me recipes how to make it quicker - 
<br>It?s too slow. 
<br>
<br>I am waiting for You... 
<br>I myself do not understand 
<br>To be true; 
<br>Why the Spring is a Winter for me 
<br>Without You. 
<br>
<br>Cambridge, 22 April 1996 
<br>
<br>
<br><hr><h3><a name="5">Rain Apology</a></h3>
<br>Of climates, Rain?s a ragamuffin, 
<br>Causing all passers at once retreat. 
<br>Even cold Snow produces laughing, 
<br>Crystal Sunshine nobody can beat. 
<br>
<br>This convention needs some fusion, 
<br>Admit a fancy into the ordinary fate 
<br>And hear the melody of ablution 
<br>By millions of droplets played. 
<br>
<br>Rain?s wonder equals in the beauty 
<br>The Creation of Darkness and Light. 
<br>To repeat a miracle is a hopeless duty, 
<br>But it rains nearly every fortnight. 
<br>
<br>In the Silent Night lies its root 
<br>And all heavenly globules of dews 
<br>Cede the elysium and down scoot 
<br>To tell the dusty Earth good news. 
<br>
<br>Yet once, the Holy thrown into mud 
<br>When the Eternal his life for us laid, 
<br>That evening rain was not a rain but 
<br>The grievous tears of the Purest Maid. 
<br>
<br>So with a prayer, I beseech the Lord, 
<br>"Let me heed delight in waterfall rustle. 
<br>Be in key of major every drizzling cord, 
<br>Clearly audible through everyday bustle. 
<br>
<br>"Let me be awaken one coy morning 
<br>By peaceful tapping from the streets, 
<br>With water from the heavens pouring 
<br>Be christened all the human deeds. 
<br>
<br>Cambridge, 26 April 1997

<br><hr><h3><a name="6">Moving out of Blue Boar Court</a></h3>
<br>My heart's in Blue Boar, My heart is not here, 
<br>My heart's in Blue Boar, it wanna be near 
<br>To friends, who ever are dear. It's so 
<br>My heart's in Blue Boar, whenever I go. 
<br>
<br>Cambridge, June 1996 
<br>
<br>
<br><hr><h3><a name="7">My First Few Days in Cambridge</a></h3>
<br>My first few days 
<br>Have lovely gone 
<br>I've got much friends 
<br>We all have fun. 
<br>
<br>My first few days 
<br>Are like a wine: 
<br>They make you drunk - 
<br>You are just fine. 
<br>
<br>My first few days 
<br>A flow of joy, 
<br>Whatever they bring 
<br>I do enjoy. 
<br>
<br>My first few days 
<br>They go along 
<br>Being so short - 
<br>Remembered long. 
<br>
<br>Cambridge, October 1995 
<br>
<br>
<br><hr><h3><a name="8">Home of Church</a></h3>
<br>Once, as a group of students from Trinity we visited Camberwell,
<br>London and the Church of St.George was our home for 3 days (and
<br>nights).
<br>
<br>Have you ever slept in church? 
<br>Stayed there for a whole night? 
<br>Has ever sung to you St.George 
<br>A lullaby made of starlight? 
<br>
<br>There is no much comfort, hither 
<br>And simply speaking it's very cold. 
<br>But imagine, if you only whisper 
<br>All the Saints will hear your call. 
<br>
<br>An angel, or Joseph, or Mary 
<br>In the sleep you must have seen, 
<br>But such a pity! I want to cry 
<br>I do not remember my dream! 
<br>
<br>Cambridge 5 May 1997 
<br>
<br>
<br><hr><h3><a name="9">Contrasts</a></h3>
<br>In bad days, in heavy rain, 
<br>Keep above you some umbrella 
<br>In the days, like days in May 
<br>Praise the moment, dear fellow. 
<br>
<br>Life is never simple thing 
<br>One cannot escape a sorrow. 
<br>During rain please always think 
<br>About sun to shine tomorrow. 
<br>
<br>Who knows, it may be so 
<br>Without such constrast; 
<br>Perpetual day would be bore 
<br>Perpetual night---disgust. 
<br>
<br>Cambridge 5 May 1997 
<br>
<br>
<br><hr><h3><a name="10">Girl</a></h3>
<br>Incidentally I bumped into you 
<br>On a street, 
<br>All of sudden I perceived your beauty 
<br>And your sweet. 
<br>
<br>Your words were streaming through the air 
<br>Like strings, 
<br>I were dreaming that your hands had brought 
<br>The early spring. 
<br>
<br>I didn't know that I was searching for you 
<br>All that time, 
<br>Until I had found you, and myself very deeply 
<br>In your eyes. 
<br>
<br>Cambridge, April 1997 
<br>
<br>
<br><hr><h3><a name="11">Prayer</a></h3>
<br>In the old Winter of my soul 
<br>Let a little bird. Her sound 
<br>Let awake the frozen lands, 
<br>Let not let remain as stands. 
<br>
<br>Let not quiteness of coldness 
<br>Calm, uneventful and sharpless 
<br>Take away the cute dilemma. 
<br>Bring to life a painful gemma! 
<br>
<br>Let me bear woe, be strong, 
<br>Take Thou not away my cross. 
<br>Should I later change my mind 
<br>Keep Thy ways, eternal light. 
<br>
<br>Cambridge, April 1997 
<br>
<br>
<br><hr><h3><a name="12">Wind-Tale</a></h3>
<br>The huge family of heavenly Winds 
<br>Is really heterogeneous, 
<br>There are lof of different functions and bits 
<br>For its members to possess. 
<br>
<br>Some Winds help vessels to sail the Seas, 
<br>The others carry the Rain, 
<br>Yet few do nothing that can us please, 
<br>Hurricans bringing in rage. 
<br>
<br>Yet there was a funny little Wind so mild, 
<br>In our flock of hard labours, 
<br>He only loitered and dreamed until one time 
<br>His kin had driven him away. 
<br>
<br>They ordered him to find a daily occupation 
<br>Respectful and honoured 
<br>They told him to reduce all his imagination 
<br>And earn his daily bread. 
<br>
<br>He was wondering in the world and singing, 
<br>And a picturesque bird 
<br>Could make him, dreamy and linging 
<br>Forgetting his daily bread. 
<br>
<br>At one persian market, just for amusement, 
<br>He stole a tiny seed 
<br>From a slopy merchant and quickly went 
<br>Into the meadows of Egypt. 
<br>
<br>With mother's tender, with lover's care 
<br>He planted tiny surprise, 
<br>He brought water to this country so rare 
<br>To perfuse his prize. 
<br>
<br>Nobody can imagine how great was Wind's joy 
<br>With the first signs from mud 
<br>Of a so slowly awaking his green toy 
<br>A stem, some leaves and a bud. 
<br>
<br>And miracle happened, in the form of the Rose 
<br>With fragrance of perfume 
<br>With crimson of fire, of a Beauty, close 
<br>To everyone's view. 
<br>
<br>The Wind's exulting mirth was as crystal fragile: 
<br>Autumn in yellow cover 
<br>Withered the Rose and brought mourn to the life 
<br>Of her pasionate lover. 
<br>
<br>He took the petals, weightless like the Star beams 
<br>Too dead to utter a word. 
<br>The Wind took little rose last time to light's streams 
<br>To show her dying the world. 
<br>
<br>And the little seed were dropping all his way 
<br>To cover the earth, 
<br>Beauty's ambassadors to appear next May, 
<br>To give them birth. 
<br>
<br>And the Roses are blossoming but no Wind doth praise 
<br>The useless dreamer-brother, 
<br>Nobody wants to comprehend that a fantasy maze 
<br>Is a labour, hundred times harder! 
<br>
<br>Cambridge, March 1997
