<p>The truth cannot always be judged by its accuracy. Real Truth, like
all the greatest things, doesn’t need anything to support itself. It even
doesn’t need to be true...
<p>I will tell you a story. At first it doesn’t seem to be closely related
to the topic, but anyway it is. Love and Indifference, Desires and Despair,
Life and Death, are strangely mixed there. It starts with a happy beginning,
with one of the real wonders ever: a new human baby, the most innocent
soul was delivered on the Earth. Unfortunately, we are very rarely concerned
with such events; our own birth is hopelessly lost in the ordeal of our
memory. The world’s machine never stops, our storage place is overwhelmed
with sensations, desires, troubles. In a great Waterfall of our life, the
beating of our heart could hardly be heard. Thousands of people are borne
every day, and nobody understands this wonderful gift of the Gods. Except
perhaps the only person - the Mother.
<p>Any new baby is always a like star light. Thousands of years rushes
it in absolute coldness and darkness. In one fair night, a Poet looks on
the stars, and all of sudden the pretty rhymes flash in his mind. It is
over in the instant, but
<p><i>Night without grief<br>
Quickly goes along,<br>
Being so brief&nbsp;<br>
Remember’d long.</i>
<p>Every baby is like Paradise after Hell, Well in a Desert, Life united
with Death, Joy borne of Sorrow.
<p>And this very Boy was very pretty indeed, especially to his Mother.
Moreover, he was alive! His tiny arms were so weak and touchy, appealing
for a protection. He was clumsily moving but he could smile so extraordinary,
and even crying he was very pretty.
<p>As days go, all boys grow and become naughty, but mothers never cease
to love them. And on one bad day, the Boy decided to leave. He had heard
a lot of stories about the Fair Princes who lived in the Palace near the
Sea and He had desire to find Her.
<p>And the Mother felt very sad, for she would rather have her hand cut,
than let her only son go. She would sing to Him the sweetest lullabies,
but He only frowned at that: “The Princess must be much sweeter.” The Mother
promised to invent the fairest tales ever heard, but He only smiled at
that: “The Princess must be much fairer.” He wasn’t any more a Boy, and
then the Mother realised that Her Son had grown a Man.
<p>“I must see the Fair Princess. Since the very moment I heard about Her,
no place has been good for me without Her. Your Tales about the Princess
were wonderful; but what is a tale compared to Life?”
<p>With a heavy heart he kissed the Mother, bade Her farewell and set off.
And the Mother felt very sad. If our lives are painted like pictures, from
that moment the Picture of Her Life would know only two colours: Red to
mean Love and Black to mean Grief. He had taken with Him all colours of
Her life except these two.
<p><i>I am waiting for You...<br>
Like the Star is waiting the Sun<br>
In the Sky;<br>
To see it, to touch it, to love it<br>
And to die</i>.
<p><i>I am waiting for You,<br>
I need not Jewels, Might&nbsp;<br>
Or Fame.<br>
Wherever I go, whispers me the Wind<br>
Your Name.</i>
<p><i>I am waiting for You...<br>
I myself do not understand<br>
To be true;<br>
Why the Spring is a Winter for me<br>
Without You.</i>
<p>The Fair Princess... Long ago Fisherman had found Her in a Sea shell
and taken to the palace where She was brought up. Usually in Sea shells
one is expecting to find jewels. And this had proved to really be the case.
<p>Her hair was like sea foam and when She combed it was like little waves
coming down. And when She spoke, it was like a water bubbling in a silver
jar. And She was moving as smoothly as a fish swimming. The Old King hadn’t
had any children, and loved Her as a daughter.
<p>One day there appeared the Young Man. He was patient, and he was waiting
on the Shore hours, days, weeks just to have a glance at her. And the people
noticed that the Princess had changed as if She was unwell. Nobody knew
the true reason, and nobody knew why the Princess was walking so frequently
to the Shore...
<p>One night she came alone. No words were said. Are there needed any words
when looks speak so much? When He grasp Her hand She trembled like a little
fish caught in a net, but He didn’t let Her go. He kissed Her, lips to
lips, as gently as a setting Sun touches the Sea...
<p><i>I’m possessed by a wonderful fairy tale<br>
No one ever knew;<br>
With a real Princess, like snow pale:<br>
The Princess was you.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Your haunting beauty was a bliss;<br>
Fragrance of dew.<br>
No great master could paint a piece<br>
Deserving you.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Glamorous Palace, where the Highnesses<br>
Grew and grew,<br>
Was made so severely famous<br>
Only because of you.</i><i></i>
<p><i>One night, from the palace, riches, delight<br>
The Princess did flee.<br>
Great sorrow in Kingdom, nobody could find<br>
Neither you, nor me...</i>
<p>The other Great Gift we have is Love. In a cold north country, there
lies a tiniest seed nobody knows about. When the Spring comes, and first
Sun beams touch the land, the Seed is awaked. Through earth and stones,
coldness and darkness, it strives for the Sun. Little by little appears
a small bud. Invisible there are going mysterious preparations inside,
so that one night appears a beautiful Rose: the Summer has begun. Unaware
of its splendour, the Rose flushes purple with every touch of Light. The
Days are delight to the Rose. Even the Nights are marvellous; you can look
at the skies, at the millions of stars. And they remind you the Sun. But
how beautiful are they, the Sun is more beautiful: when it arises, they
hide, not being able to stand its brightness. But sometimes you feel sad,
and there are little tears of dew. But even the smallest Sun beams would
make them disappear. Pity the Rose when the Autumn comes. The Sun changes;
it doesn’t bring any warm, the trees prepare for a comfortable sleep. But
the Rose cannot: it dies. Winter embroiders its grave with a white savant
of snow for a peace and a rest.
<p>The Rose is dead. But if in the Spring the inconstant Sun touches the
dead rose in its grave with a little promise of warmth and gentleness,
a miracle would happen. The Rose would rise. The wounds healed, the suffering
forgotten... The Rose is Love, the Sun is the object of our Love.
<p>One day the Princess was forlorn: He had gone. She was sitting on the
Shore all days long, longing to reach over the horizon. The Sea was whispering
to Her wonderful stories but She only heard His voice as He bad Her farewell:
<p>“My Fair Princess, your eyes are like two little deep ponds with a treasure
inside, when you smile it is like a lively butterfly soaring off a flower,
and your hands are as graceful as a white swam. Yet I must get across the
Sea as far as no Swam can fly, walk through the Desert with no ponds in
hundreds of miles around, clime up the Mountains where no flowers can grow.
My fate is painful, but I have to find that wonderful Town of Scholars
and the best Teacher to teach me the Truth.”
<p>He was resolute. Nothing had stopped Him, nor the Sea, nor the Desert,
nor the Mountains, nor even the tears of His Sweetheart. He had met the
most famous Teacher and begged Him for the Scholarship offering anything
in return. The Teacher was quite old and was pleased to find such an extraordinary
and determined Student. The Teacher as if saw Himself young and was happy
to give away all the Wisdom acquired during a long life. It was like all
His life was reborn in this new Student...
<p>Books themselves, even the thickest ones, don’t give any Wisdom. Neither
they radiate warmth. Can they make anybody happier? Do they speak? They
lie on shelves getting covered with dust, motionless and silent.
<p>But when comes a Real Scholar everything changes; Books becoming alive.
When you open Music Books with a bit of luck you can hear celebrated pieces.
Poetry Books are constantly humming into your ear new rhymes. Even Mathematical
Books with a cunning face rearrange their formulas. You can visit Ancient
Greece, find your Juliet, or invent the Theory of Relativity. Learning
is infinite. If you can make Books alive, it is an infinite Freedom. If
you cannot, it is an infinite Prison.
<p>The Student was reading thick books and manuscripts in Philosophy all
days and nights, year after year. He was suffering much, but this sacrifice
was in vain: the Books were dead... And He told the Teacher rude and evil
words. The Teacher couldn’t stand it and His Heart broke. Teachers’ sacrifice
is always much larger: they give away their Soul. In a great fear flew
away the Student.
<p>The world is great. There are millions of people, thousands of towns,
hundreds of countries. And yet there were no place for Him to go, and He
was getting older and older..
<p><i>Take my heart away,<br>
It brings me only pain.<br>
I hear its beating every day -<br>
Like drops of Autumn rain.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Like drops of Autumn rain<br>
My tears, my thoughts, my eyes<br>
My hands, my head, my brain:<br>
Too heavy to fly in the skies.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Too heavy to fly in the skies -<br>
My only chance to meet<br>
The only love that never lies<br>
The only lips like roses sweet</i>
<p>But there were no place for Him even after the Death. For said the Angel,
“You built no House in the Heaven, and you will always be on your way in
the search of Truth.” But the Oldster pleaded, “Please show me the Truth!”
<p>As if veil was drawn away, and the Oldster saw His Mother. And She was
young and sang a lullaby for a small boy in whom He recognised Himself.
She was smiling at a remote Star and the song was light and easy as Moonlight.
And there were no black colours in the Picture of Her Life.
<p>“Look!” said the Angel, “For Her you are the nicest, fairest young boy
that ever was born on under the Heavens. And This is Truth, for there is
nothing impossible for the God if one has a grain of Faith. But in Her
world there is no place for you - old and weary, unperfected as you are.”
<p>Then the second vision appeared. He saw Himself but much younger embracing
the happy Princess. And also there was the reddest ever growing Rose under
the ever glowing Sun. He shouted to Her, but He left that world, and there
were no ways back.
<p>The third sight appeared. The Student and the Teacher were walking together,
the Teacher was telling the stories and the Student was happily listening.
Before then there was laying an endless bright path of Learning.
<p>Then everything suddenly disappeared. He cried in despair, but He had
no Mother to soothe Him. The Sea, the Desert and the Mountains were separating
Him from His Lover. No Teacher could show him the way. He is still wandering
somewhere trying to find the three visions, not quite believing that he
has actually seen them...
<p>The Truth is inside us. Every human being is a cosmos of ideas and desires,
emotions and beliefs. Every such little cosmos, is unique, real and true.
Because if you believe in something very much it will eventually prove
to be true. Can one believe in something not evident? So every Truth is
always “self-evident”. We can be even more optimistic: there will be Real
Truths, as long as there are the Earth, the Heaven, and the People who
live, love, suffer, and search for the truth.
