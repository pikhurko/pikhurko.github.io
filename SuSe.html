<it>The best way to master a computer is to never allow it to beat
you. Always make it do precisely what you want. I practised that and
now my computer is most obedient.

Finally, I have made a resolution to maintain a log-file of my linux
box! Recently, I have installed Linux SuSe 9.0 and this version feels
so nice and pleasant that I decided to follow the guru's advice.

<p>
The log-file seems a stimulus to be organised and a good place to put
various tricks of the trade that I happen to discover. Furthermore,
I decided to put it on web not in order to boast but rather keep it
always at hand when I need to recollect something. So, this is for my
personal use but anybody is very welcome to have a look and share their
experience :-)
