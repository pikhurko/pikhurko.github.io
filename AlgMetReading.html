<h1>
Algebraic Methods in Combinatorics:</h1>
Some suggestions for reading.

<br><br><hr><br>

Here are some textbooks and articles that are related to the
course.
 <ol>
<li>
N. Alon, <i>Tools from higher algebra</i>, Handbook of Combinatorics (R.
L. Graham, M.Grotschel, and L. Lovasz, eds.), Elsevier Science B.V., 1995,
pp.1749-1785 (<b>Moore Lib. QA164.H33</b>)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
[An excellent survey, with some proofs and many references. Almost everything
what is there is related to the course, but unfortunately I'll have to
omit much because lack of time.]</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
N. Alon, <i>Combinatorial Nullstellensatz</i>, Combinatorics, Probability
and Computing <b>8</b> (1999) 7-29.</li><br>
[Contains some recent results not in the previous survey.]

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
L. Babai and P. Frankl, Linear Algebra Methods in Combinatorics, Manuscript
1992.&nbsp;<br>
[Unfortunately, this monograph has not been completed, let alone published.
It is available from the the Department of Computer Science, University
of Chicago (who charge about $30 for printing and shipping). I have deposited 
a copy in the Moore Library: <b>QA184.B33 1992</b>. Don't be
scared by 200+ pages - it goes at a leisurely pace, with lots of good exercises.
Chapters 2, 5, 6 are related.]</li>

C. G. Godsil, <i>Tools from linear algebra</i>, Handbook of Combinatorics
(R. L. Graham, M.Grotschel, and L. Lovasz, eds.), Elsevier Science B.V.,
1995, pp.1705-1748 (<b>Moore Lib. QA164.H33</b>).&nbsp;<br>
[Sections 2 &amp; 4.]<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
M. Aigner and G. M. Ziegler, Proofs from The Book, Springer 1998 (<b>Moore
Lib. QA36.A36 1998 &amp; QA36.A36 2000</b>).&nbsp;<br>
[A hightly entertaining book (general mathematics, not only combinatorics).
Read Chapter 15 on Borsuk's conjecture. Also, Chapter 28 on the Shannon
capacity might be related.]</li>
