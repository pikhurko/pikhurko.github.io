<h1>4-Year PhD Scholarship</h1>


A 4-year PhD scholarship is available at the University of Warwick,
 funded by  Oleg Pikhurko's ERC advanced grant 
"Finite and Descriptive Combinatorics". The starting date is 1st October 2022.

<h2>Possible research directions</h2>

This broad project allows for a wide range of possible directions for PhD research, depending on the applicant's background and interests.
In addition to extremal (finite) combinatorics, other possibilities are to explore
deep emerging connections between combinatorics and other fields, such as analysis, 
descriptive set theory, distributed algorithms, measured group theory,
semi-definite programming, 
etc, with applications going both ways. 

<!--

A typical problem of Extremal Combinatorics is to maximise or
minimise a certain parameter given some combinatorial
restrictions. The structures that we consider are
usually graphs and set systems but they may also be, for example,
sets of integers or faces of a polytope.  This area experienced a remarkable growth in the last
few decades, having a wide range of applications 
(in number theory, algebra, geometry, logic,
information theory,  theoretical computer science, etc). <!-- There are also 
many practical fields that were greatly
influenced by ideas from Extremal Combinatorics such as, for example,
analysis of large networks or shotgun cloning
of DNA fragments.
On the other hand, tools from other areas are now
widely used to solve combinatorial problems.--><p> 

For example, many open problems of (finite) combinatorics were recently solved by using
<i>limits</i>  of discrete structures. 
Roughly, the idea here is to approximate, say, a large graph G by some object W
of bounded complexity. 
Now we can deal with W alone (in some sense, we take the "limit" as the number of vertices of G tends to infinity). 
Remarkably, the set of possible "limits" W for dense graphs can be described in many ways: 
using two-variable symmetric measurable real functions (called <i>graphons</i>), random infinite graphs or infinite positive semi-definite connection matrices. 
This gives a general way to apply tools from e.g. real analysis to finite graphs (and also makes the analytic limit structures
into objects of great independent interest).
<p>
In the other direction, combinatorial methods and ideas have been very successfully applied 
to various questions of analysis and descriptive set theory such as, for example, to find a constructive proof of Tarski's 
circle-squaring problem, where one has to divide a disk in the plane into finitely many "definable" pieces
and rearrange them to form a square.
<p>

Finally, yet another possible direction for PhD research is to use computers to attack questions of extremal combinatorics within the framework of 
flag algebras. Although there are a few freely available software packages for this, a new problem often requires quite extensive coding. If you are interested in this kind of work, please make sure to state this and describe your previous programming experience in detail in your application.


<!-- I recommend a very nice survey by L&aacute;szl&oacute; Lov&aacute;sz 
(<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0132">http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0132</a>) if you want to learn more about graph limits. --> 
<!--
Here are two recent papers where this "limit approach" is used:
<lu>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3074">http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3074</a>: Roughly, a order-n permutation S is <i>quasirandom</i> if all k-term subsequences appear with frequency 1/k!+o(1) (ie are almost equally likely) when k is much smaller than n. Answering a question of Ron Graham, it is shown that it is enough to check only the case k=4. The method here is to replace the permutation S by a probability measure W on the unit square (so that all k-term frequences in S can be estimated from W when n is large).
</li><br>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4393">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4393</a>: In 1962 Paul Erdos asked about the smallest number of k-cliques in a graph with n vertices and independence number less than l. Flag algebras gave us a way to let a computer prove bounds for this problem that apply for <b>all</b> n. This led to a complete solution of this 50-year old problem in the cases when (k,l) is one of (3,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) and (7,3) while n is large.

<h2>Combinatorics at Warwick</h2>


The <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/">Warwick Mathematics Institute</a> has an 
increasing number of people who directly work in combinatorics (our current 
permanent staff members include 
<a href="https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~maslar/">Agelos Georgakopoulos</a>, 
<a href="http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/H.Liu.9/">Hong Liu</a>, 
<a href="http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masgax/">Vadim Lozin</a>, and 
<a href="https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/O.Pikhurko/">Oleg Pikhurko</a>) as well as a number of 
research groups in related areas. We have the weekly  <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/seminars/areas/combinatorics/">Combinatorics Seminar</a> and the (general) <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/colloquium">Mathematics Colloquium</a>.<p>

Additionally, the <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/dimap/">Centre for Discrete Mathematics and its Applications (DIMAP)</a> promotes multidisciplinary research spanning three departments (Business School, Computer Science and Mathematics). The centre has many <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/dimap/staff/">affiliated researchers</a> and runs the <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/dimap/seminars/">DIMAP seminar</a>.
Also, the Department of Computer Science has the active and large 
<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/focs/">Theory 
and Foundations Group</a>. <p>

<!-- Also, we are within a short train journey from Birmingham, London, and Oxford. -->

<h2>Scholarhip Particulars</h2>

The scholarship will pay a stipend for 4 years (subject to candidate's making good progress and meeting 
some standard requirements) and 
all tuition fees (at home or overseas level). It also privides 2,500 euro per year for research-related travel and 1,500 euro for buying a laptop.<p>

<!-- <b>Important:</b> If you are not a EU citizen, you would need to find  extra funding that covers
the difference between the overseas and EU rates (which is around 14,000 GBP per year). 
This difference may be covevered by a <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/academicoffice/gsp/scholarship/typesoffunding/phd/chancellorsinternationalscholarships">Chancellor's International Scholarship</a>
(whose deadline is <b>13 January 2014</b>).<p>

<!--
An ideal candidate should have a great interest in combinatorics and a broad mathematical background. While a previous knowledge and close familiarity with these areas will be an advantage, it is not required. Rather, I will be looking for your depth of knowledge, willingness to learn new areas and your general
potential as a successful researcher.
One aspect of this broad project is to work on areas on the borderline between combinatorics and analysis, descriptive set theory, distributed algorithms, probability theory and semi-definite programming; so candidates with a strong background in one of these areas are  encouraged to apply.<p>
