<h1>Hiking Trip on 5 July (Sunday)</h1>

There will be an informal hiking trip on 5 July to which the participants of the LMS-CMI Research School
and the 25th British Combinatorial Conference who happen to be around are cordially invited. We meet <b>1:30pm</b> at the
front entrance to the Mathematics Institute (building 38 on 
<a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/about/visiting/maps/campusmap/">the campus map</a>).
Then we will walk to the <a href="https://www.warwickdc.gov.uk/info/20316/abbey_fields">Abbey 
Fields</a> in <a href="http://www.kenilworthweb.co.uk/">Kenilworth</a> 
(<a href="route-map.pdf">6-7km walk</a>, large part going through a nice countryside).<p>

There are various things that people may self-organise to do once we are there, such as
<ul>
 <li>listen to a <a href="http://bandsinthepark.org.uk/warks.html">band playing</a> (2:30-4:30pm);</li>
 <li>visit <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/kenilworth-castle/">Kenilworth
Castle</a> (which is open until 6pm);</li>
 <li>picnic (there are about 4-5 picnic tables and plenty of grass; one can get food from Sainsburys and Waitrose which are very close);</li>
 <li>do some sports: eg there are a swimming pool and (free, on first-come basis) tennis courts;</li>
 <li>continue the hike making 15-20km loop ending back on the campus (if there is interest, we will lead it or provide a map).</li>
</ul>

Other options of getting back to the campus include:
<ul>
 <li>walking back the same way (a very clear and well marked route);</li>
 <li>calling a taxi (eg Kenilwoth-based Call-Line Taxis at 01926267068 or campus-based Trinity Street Taxis at 02476999999);</li>
 <li>taking bus <a href="http://nxbus.co.uk/routes/coventry/C011/?timetable[day]=&">11</a> or <a href="https://www.stagecoachbus.com/localdefault.aspx?Tag=Warwick">U17</a> (rather infrequent on Sundays).</li> 
</ul>

Anybody interested (including friends/partners) is welcome to join. This trip is not
sponsored by the School/Conference so its participants will need to pay all their expenses.<p>

We hope to see many of you there!<p>
